# AO3 Front End Documentation

These pages are, like the Archive, a work in progress.

It is not necessary to read all these pages before you start coding! They are intended to be references you can use as you go along. But whether you're a beginner or have previous experience with <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, it's very important that you refer to these documents and read the [Front End User Guide](front-end-user-guide) and the [Coding Standards](coding-standards) before you commit any code to the Archive.

## Getting started with HTML and CSS

1.  [What is Semantic HTML?](/basics/semantic-html)
2.  [What is CSS?](/baiscs/css)
3.  [Writing a Skin](/basics/writing-a-skin)

## How we code stuff

Our coding practice may be radically different from anything you've done before. While our standards may seem limiting and fussy at first, they are designed to keep the code (and the Archive interface) as neat, consistent, and manageable as possible.

* [Coding Standards](coding-standards)
* [Front End User Guide](front-end-user-guide)
* [Coding Accessible Tables](coding-accessible-tables)
* [Style Guide](style-guide)
* [Classes](classes)
	* [CSS Taxonomy](taxonomy)
* [Em Scale](em-scale)
* [Accessibility Statement](accessibility-statement)

### How we structure things

Design patterns are a major part of how we code things. While not every new feature will fit an existing pattern, we strive to reuse as much XHTML and CSS as possible.

* [XHTML Page Templates](patterns/xhtml-page-templates)
* [Diagrams of Regions](patterns/regions)
* [Design Pattern: Actions](patterns/actions)
* [Design Pattern: Interactions](patterns/interactions)
* [Design Pattern: Index](patterns/index)
* [Design Pattern: Blurb](patterns/blurb)
* [Design Pattern: Listbox](patterns/listbox)
* [Design Pattern: Meta](patterns/meta)
* [Design Pattern: Preface](patterns/preface)
* [Design Pattern: Comments](patterns/comments)
* [Design Pattern: Stats](patterns/stats)
